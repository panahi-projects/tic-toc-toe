# Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game, written in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a fun project that I've created during my leisure time, and I hope you enjoy playing it.

Currently, the game supports 2-player mode, where two players can take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, then the game ends in a draw.

In the future, I plan to implement 1-player mode, where the computer will play against the human player. This will add an extra level of challenge and fun to the game.

To play, simply click on a square to place your mark (X or O). 

I hope you have fun playing Tic Tac Toe! Let me know if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements.
